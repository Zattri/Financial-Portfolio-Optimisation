# Stock Portfolio Optimisation using Genetic Algorithms
Coursework for Modern Optimisation module from MSc Big Data Analytics

This project involved the usage of genetic algorithms and evaluation functions to find potential solutions to a problem along an optimal front. In this case the goal was to find optimal stock market portfolio investment choices from a dataset of stock market price values from the S&P500 over a year. The evaluation functions were used determine the risk factor and profitability of a stock, where genetic algorithms aimed to optimise portfolio investment weights based on these two factors.
